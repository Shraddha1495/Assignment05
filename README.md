# Data Transformation using Python

This project is extracting 1000 rows from 4000 rows excel file. 
We are using youtube dataset which contains the details of various channel types and no. of suscribers respectively. 


## Appendix

We have used iloc function in python for extraction. 
We have created a function to calculate the distribution of channetype
from the top 1000 records. The filtered 1000 records were further 
saved in the new csv file. We have used python as a 
programming language to build this project. The distribution plot 
was plotted using distplot function from seaborn library.
